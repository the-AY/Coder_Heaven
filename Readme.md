### How to start (Placement preparation)
<details><summary>Click here to know more</summary>
<p>
 ## Newbie guide to get started with programming

  Use a good IDE/code editor and make one folder to save all your code for easier access make a github account and learn the push, pull, commit, clone operations and then your ready to collaborate with your teammates VS code is one of the best one as it supports  almost every coding language and many extension available  

  ### Web development 
  <br>(Web Browser for Development - <b>Mozilla Developer Edition</b>)<br>
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/<br

- After you do the prerequiste of insatlling VS code you can start learning basic html, CSS, JavaScript from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> <b>w3cschools</b> </a> use "Live server" (needs to be added does come built in) extension in vs code to see realtime changes in the website. make a small project using the things you learnt as making project and learning things is one way to learn things, its okay the first project maybe pointless, no idea, no structure but the first step towards it matters.
After the initiall version of the project learn to add more features to the website and learn a programming language for the backend explore NoSQl and Sql languages
